Save the zip file to your computer and extract it to a folder.
 
## Step 2: Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin its driver installation process
 
Connect your Funduino Uno R3 board to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure the power LED on the board is on. Windows will detect the new device and try to install the driver automatically. If the installer does not launch automatically, follow the next steps.
 
## Step 3: Navigate to the Windows Device Manager and find the Funduino Uno R3 listing
 
Open the Windows Device Manager by clicking Start > Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Device Manager. You will see a list of devices connected to your computer. Find the Funduino Uno R3 listing under Other devices or Ports (COM & LPT). It may be labeled as Unknown device or USB Serial Device.
 
## Step 4: Right click and choose Update driver
 
Right click on the Funduino Uno R3 listing and choose Update driver software from the menu. A dialog window will appear.
 
## Step 5: Choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and click Next
 
At the next screen, choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and click Next. This will allow you to select the folder where you extracted the driver software in step 1.
 
## Step 6: Click the Browse button and select the drivers folder
 
Click the Browse button and navigate to the folder where you extracted the driver software. Select the drivers folder and click OK, then click Next. Windows will search for the driver files in that folder.
 
## Step 7: Ignore the warning message and click Continue Anyway
 
You may receive a warning message that says "Windows can't verify the publisher of this driver software". This is because the driver software is not digitally signed by Microsoft. However, you can safely ignore this message and click Continue Anyway. The driver software is safe and compatible with your board.
 
## Step 8: Wait for the installation to finish and press Close
 
After a few moments, a window will tell you that Windows has successfully updated your driver software. Press Close to exit. Your Funduino Uno R3 board is now ready to use with your computer.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to install Funduino Uno R3 driver on Windows 7, Vista and 10. This will allow you to upload sketches and communicate with your board via the USB port. You can now start exploring various projects with your Funduino Uno R3 board.
